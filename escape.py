# A simple text adventure game that showcases the elements of a text
# adventure game such as movement, inventory, game states, clearing of 
# screen, saving and loading save files, debugging/debug mode, etc.
#
# There are five rooms in this text adventure.
#
# To enable debug mode - make sure the debug flag is set to 1, then type
# "xyzzy" at any time during the game.
#
# To save/load game, type "save" or "load" at any time during the game.
# (Save files generated by this game is compatible with C version of 
# Escape.)
#
# I have tried to anticipate everything a player could type in the game 
# and developed a response for each potential input.
#
# Walkthrough - E, TAKE PAPER, PRESS YELLOW, PRESS GREEN, W, N, OPEN PANEL,
# PRESS BLACK, CLOSE PANEL, S, S, TAKE PLANTER, TAKE BRASS, TAKE RUBBISH,
# OPEN PANEL, PRESS RED, PRESS BLUE, CLOSE PANEL, N, E, OPEN BOX, TAKE KEY,
# CLOSE BOX, PRESS YELLOW, PRESS GREEN, W, N, OPEN PANEL, PRESS BLACK,
