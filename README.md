(Updated September 28, 2022 - completely rewrote the code.)

A simple text adventure game that showcases the elements of a text adventure game such as movement, inventory, game states, clearing of screen, saving and loading save files, debugging/debug mode, etc.

There are five rooms in this text adventure.

To enable debug mode - make sure the debug flag is set to 1, then type "xyzzy" at any time during the game.

To save/load game, type "save" or "load" at any time during the game.

(Save files generated by this game is compatible with C version of Escape.)

I have tried to anticipate everything a player could type in the game and developed a response for each potential input.
